- **OpenAPI integration** continues to work for external API calls
- **Enhanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) support** added May 2025
- **Remote server connections** now supported (Stripe, Shopify, Twilio)
- **Responses API** launched March 2025 provides enterprise-grade action capabilities

### üîß Current GPT Actions Capabilities (May 2025)

- **Native integrations**: Direct connections to major business tools
- **MCP server support**: Remote tool integration with minimal code
- **Multi-step workflows**: Context retention across action sequences  
- **Enterprise features**: Background processing, encrypted reasoning, audit logs
- **Image generation**: GPT-4o native image creation ("gpt-image-1" model)
- **Code Interpreter**: Built-in data analysis and programming execution

### üìä Technical Architecture Updates

1. **Responses API Integration** - Production-ready agent development
2. **Background Mode** - Long-running asynchronous task handling
3. **Reasoning Summaries** - Transparent decision-making explanations
4. **Multi-store File Search** - Advanced document retrieval with filtering
5. **Zero Data Retention** - Enterprise security for sensitive operations

## ü§ñ Current Model Landscape (May 2025)

### Available Models in ChatGPT

- **GPT-4o**: Default multimodal model (text, voice, vision)
- **GPT-4.1**: New model with 1M token context, enhanced coding (launched May 2025)
- **GPT-4.1 mini**: Replaces GPT-4o mini across all tiers
- **o3-mini**: Fast reasoning model for logical problems
- **o3-mini-high**: Deeper reasoning, slower execution
- **o1-pro**: Premium reasoning model (Pro subscribers only)
- **Deep Research**: Specialized research agent with web access

### Model Selection Complexity

- **9 distinct models** available to Pro subscribers (as of May 2025)
- **User confusion widely reported** across Reddit and OpenAI forums
- **GPT-5 consolidation planned** - unified branding coming "months" (per Sam Altman)
- **GPT-4.5** launching "weeks" as final standalone model

## üè¢ Enterprise Custom GPT Patterns (2025)

### Production Deployment Strategies

- **Domain specialization**: 85%+ accuracy improvements over base models
- **Knowledge base integration**: Uploaded documents + real-time data access
- **Multi-agent workflows**: Collaborative agent systems for complex tasks
- **Governance frameworks**: Data tracking, access controls, compliance monitoring
- **Security protocols**: Encrypted reasoning, audit trails, zero retention options

### Evaluation Methodologies

1. **Multi-criteria assessment**: Beyond simple comparison testing
2. **Real-world dataset validation**: Production data vs. synthetic benchmarks
3. **Attribution bias controls**: Blind evaluation protocols
4. **Longitudinal performance tracking**: Improvement measurement over time
5. **Expert validation layers**: Domain specialist review processes

## üî¨ 2025 Research Developments

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Specialized domain F1 scores**: 0.92+ for medical, legal, technical fields
- **Instruction following accuracy**: 95%+ adherence in controlled environments
- **Context retention**: 1M+ token handling in GPT-4.1 series
- **Multi-modal integration**: Enhanced image, text, voice processing capabilities

### Current Limitations

- **Model picker complexity**: User experience degradation from choice overload
- **Integration setup requirements**: Technical expertise needed for advanced features
- **Cost management**: Variable pricing across model tiers and tool usage
- **Performance variation**: Inconsistent behavior across different use cases

## üìà Enhancement Opportunities

### Proven Effective Approaches
