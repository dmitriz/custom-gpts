Please evaluate and compare the following AI-generated responses using the uploaded rulebook.

**Response A:**
To build an API, you should use REST because it's standard. Add JSON endpoints and call it from your frontend using fetch.

**Response B:**
When building an API, you must consider architectural style. REST is widely used, but GraphQL may offer advantages when clients need flexible querying. JSON is common, but standards like JSON:API or OpenAPI add structure. Use authentication such as OAuth2 if security is needed.

**Response C:**
An API is like a restaurant menu â€” you pick something and it comes back. Use POST and GET methods. APIs are really helpful.
