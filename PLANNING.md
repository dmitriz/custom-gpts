# Custom GPT Testing Project - Planning & Ideas

## Project Goal

Testing custom GPTs on ChatGPT platform for professional-level AI assistance. Focus on quality evaluation and best practices.

## Workflow Rules (Strict Adherence Required)

- **NO implementation without explicit approval**
- **HIGH-IMPACT, QUICK WINS ONLY** - everything else goes to planning
- **SHORT responses only** - no long explanations
- **NO examples unless approved** - examples can confuse/bias
- **CRITICAL review only** - discard minor items

## Immediate High-Impact Issues to Fix

1. **URGENT: Scoring system incomplete** - evaluator instructions lack 1-5 scale definitions
2. **Test case mismatch** - current test uses API topic but project may need different focus

## Future Ideas (Capture Only - No Implementation)

- Expand test coverage to different technical topics
- Add edge case testing
- Research MCP servers for additional capabilities
- Best practices documentation
- Sustainable project structure

## Notes

- Focus on most urgent items only
- Using online pull request reviewers for feedback
- Concern about examples causing confusion/bias in evaluation
