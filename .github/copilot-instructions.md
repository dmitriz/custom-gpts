# GitHub Copilot Instructions & Rules

## Code Review & Change Management Rules

## Project Structure Rules

- **Only create folders when busy** - Start with top-level files, folder when needed
- **Use clear directory names** - Avoid ambiguous names like "tests" for evaluations

## Workflow Rules

- **HIGH-IMPACT, QUICK WINS ONLY** - Everything else goes to planning
